# n8n-nodes-puppeteer-wait

![n8n.io - Workflow Automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n8n-io/n8n/master/assets/n8n-logo.png)

[n8n](https://www.n8n.io) node for requesting webpages using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the [DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/). 
This version is based on [n8n-nodes-puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-puppeteer) but with the option to have a wait time between chromium render the page and the screenshot.

## How to install

### Community Nodes (Recommended)

For users on n8n v0.187+, your instance owner can install this node from [Community Nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/).

1. Go to **Settings > Community Nodes**.
2. Select **Install**.
3. Enter `n8n-nodes-puppeteer` in **Enter npm package name**.
4. Agree to the [risks](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/risks/) of using community nodes: select **I understand the risks of installing unverified code from a public source**.
5. Select **Install**.

After installing the node, you can use it like any other node. n8n displays the node in search results in the **Nodes** panel.

### Manual installation

To get started install the package in your n8n root directory:

`npm install n8n-nodes-puppeteer`


For Docker-based deployments, you'll need to make sure [puppeteer is installed](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/puppeteer/troubleshooting/#running-puppeteer-in-docker) first. Then, add the following line before the font installation command in your [n8n Dockerfile](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/Dockerfile):


`RUN cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n && npm install n8n-nodes-puppeteer`

## Node Reference

* **Operations**
    * Get the full HTML contents of the page
    * Capture the contents of a page as a PDF document
    * Capture screenshot of all or part of the page

* **Options**
    * All Operations
        * **Emulate Device**: Allows you to specify a [device](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/src/common/DeviceDescriptors.ts) to emulate when requesting the page.
        * **Extra Headers**: Allows you add additional headers when requesting the page.
        * **Timeout**: Allows you to specify tge maximum navigation time in milliseconds. You can pass 0 to disable the timeout entirely.
        * **Wait Until**: Allows you to change how Puppeteer considers navigation completed.
            * `load`: The load event is fired.
            * `DOMContentLoaded`: The DOMContentLoaded event is fired.
            * `networkidle0`: No more than 0 connections for at least 500 ms.
            * `networkidle2`: No more than 2 connections for at least 500 ms.
        * **Page Caching**: Allows you to toggle whether pages should be cached when requesting.
        * **Headless mode**: Allows you to change whether to run browser runs in headless mode or not.
        * **Stealth mode**: When enabled, applies various techniques to make detection of headless Puppeteer harder. Powered by [puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/tree/master/packages/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth).
        * **Launch Arguments**: Allows you to specify additional command line arguments passed to the browser instance.
        * **Proxy Server**: Allows Puppeteer to use a custom proxy configuration. You can specify a custom proxy configuration in three ways:
            By providing a semi-colon-separated mapping of list scheme to url/port pairs.
            For example, you can specify:

                http=foopy:80;ftp=foopy2

            to use HTTP proxy "foopy:80" for http URLs and HTTP proxy "foopy2:80" for ftp URLs.

            By providing a single uri with optional port to use for all URLs.
            For example:

                foopy:8080

            will use the proxy at foopy:8080 for all traffic.

            By using the special "direct://" value.

                direct://" will cause all connections to not use a proxy.
